<p>By default, TFSHOP will provide a set of simple background and uniapp themes to facilitate developers to experience the whole process of TFSHOP. Of course, you can also develop the background and uniapp theme yourself, because TFSHOP is separated from the front end, so there is no limit to whether the front end uses vue or react.</p>
