## What are its advantages and disadvantages?
### Merit
> Clean and elegant code
> 
> Light enough weight
> 
> Easy to redevelop
> 
> Based on MIT, completely free and open source, no license is required for commercial use
> 
> Support for multiple languages
> 
> Front and rear end separation, loose coupling, easy to expand
> 
### Drawback
> Based on third-party package dependence, the project volume is large
> 
> Need to master the newer technology stack: vue+laravel+ts+uniapp, etc
> 
> Hard to get started, quick to get started, hard to get deep
> 
> The function is simple, only provides the basic functions of the mall, and the follow-up may develop in a minimalist direction, which is not suitable for simple modification to be online, and the secondary development is needed
> 
> The front and back ends are separated, and maintenance is not very convenient. After modifying the front end, you need to repackage and upload it
