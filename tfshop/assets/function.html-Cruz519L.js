The direct association between users and permissions is canceled, and permissions are indirectly granted to users through user-associated roles and role-associated permissions (as shown in the figure below), so as to achieve the purpose of decoupling users and permissions. <img src="'+e+'" alt="图片"></p><ul><li>Users and roles have a many-to-many relationship, that is, a user can play several roles at the same time, and a role can have multiple users</li><li>High flexibility, accurate to each action, can use different background homepages for different roles, one-click assignment, and takes effect at any time</li></ul><h2 id="product-sku" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#product-sku"><span>Product SKU</span></a></h2><p>SKU = stock keeping unit SKU is the unit of measurement of inventory in and out (buyer purchase, merchant purchase, supplier stocking, and factory production are all based on SKUs).</p><p>A SKU is the smallest SKU that is physically indivisible. In other words, a commodity can determine the specific stock of goods according to the SKU.</p><p>For example, a pink (three colors: pink, yellow, and black) Zara women&#39;s trench coat in M size (four sizes: S, M, L, X) is a combination of SKUs.</p><p>When the SKU is generated, the corresponding Cartesian product will be generated according to the attributes, and the inventory of the product can be determined according to a set of SKUs, so the above Zara women&#39;s trench coat has a total of 4 * 3 = 12 SKU combinations.</p><p>The combination of M size + pink is called a set of SKUs, because the SKU is the smallest physical indivisible stock storage unit, and there is no way to confirm the stock status of this product based on size or color alone.</p><p>In the same way, the merchant&#39;s replenishment is also done through SKUs, just ask the Taobao store and the supplier that I want 100 red women&#39;s windbreakers? Does the supplier know how to stock him?</p><p>Apparently not knowing. Because there is also a lack of another sales attribute [size].</p><p>All products adopt SKU mode, if you need a single-attribute mode, please bind a single-attribute SKU to the product.</p><p>Products support the addition of images and videos</p><p>Products can have different main images for each SKU combination</p><h2 id="shipping-templates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shipping-templates"><span>Shipping templates</span></a></h2><p>It is a shipping tool that is launched for sellers who need to frequently modify the shipping cost after the transaction is completed.

Shipping templates can be configured in multiple sets, and templates can be copied to quickly generate new shipping templates.</p><h2 id="shopping-cart" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shopping-cart"><span>Shopping cart</span></a></h2><p>Users can add items to their cart</p><p>You can modify the specifications of the product on the shopping cart screen</p><p>Emptying of shopping carts is allowed</p><p>Deletion of cart items is allowed</p><p>Some items are allowed to be selected for checkout</p><p>The product is invalid, and the shopping cart is marked as invalid</p><h2 id="shipping-mock-board" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shipping-mock-board"><span>Shipping Mock Board</span></a></h2><p>A tool launched for users who need to frequently modify the delivery address after the transaction is concluded.
